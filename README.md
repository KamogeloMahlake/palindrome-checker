# Palindrome Checker

This repository contains a simple web application that checks if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

## How It Works

- Enter a string into the input field.
- Click the "Check" button.
- The result will display whether the entered string is a palindrome.

## Usage

## Code Overview

The main functionality is implemented in `script.js`:

- Listens for a click event on the "Check" button.
- Reads the value from the input field.
- Removes non-alphanumeric characters and checks if the string is a palindrome.
- Displays the result.
